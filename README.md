# NODE101-Hello-HTTP-Server
I used Node.js to build my first web server that responds with "Hello World".

Steps Taken:
Cloned original project code from git@github.com:SanDiegoCodeSchool/node101-hello-http-server.git
Installed dependencies with npm install command
Updated index.js file by requiring the http module from Node.js
Created a server object that can send headers and body response
Added a listener so that my server could handle incoming connections
Logged a message when the server starts so you will know where it is listening and the port number
